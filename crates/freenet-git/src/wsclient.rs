//! Thin wrapper around `freenet-stdlib`'s `WebApi` for the operations the
//! `freenet-git` CLI needs: connect, PUT a contract, GET a state.
//!
//! The complexity in this file is mostly about *waiting for the right
//! response*: when we PUT with `subscribe: true`, the host can respond
//! with either a `PutResponse` or an `UpdateNotification` first, and we
//! need to accept either as success while ignoring unrelated notifications
//! that may interleave.
